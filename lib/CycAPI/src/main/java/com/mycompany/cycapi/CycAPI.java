/**
 * This class provides a simple example of working with the Cyc KB through the Cyc Core API. It 
 * includes new term creation, term retrieval, asserting and deleting facts about terms, and 
 * querying the Cyc KB. 
 * 
 * <p>The purpose of this class is to illustrate the basics of the Cyc Core API, so it is structured
 * to be read in linear order, from top to bottom, with methods that build upon the examples in
 * previous methods. Thus, while this file demonstrates best practices for Core API usage, it does 
 * not represent the ideal structure for an actual application class.
 * 
 * <p>All of the example code in this class should work with all Cyc server releases supported by 
 * the Cyc Core API.
 * 
 * @note There are multiple ways of interacting with Cyc (through and independent of the Core API).
 * The illustrations here are some of the more popular techniques.

       Closing the query performs clean up operations. Not closing queries leaves objects in the Cyc
       server, and can cause memory leaks.  The finalize method on the query closes it, thereby 
       releasing resources on the Cyc server, but it is performed at the mercy of the garbage 
       collector.  To ensure that the resources are released promptly on the server, the query 
       should generally be closed as soon as you are done with it and its directly related objects
       (such as any QueryResultSets).
       
       This is especially important when a query has been run as "browsable" (which this query was),
       as the Cyc server will hold onto resources for that query even after the calling application
       has terminated.
